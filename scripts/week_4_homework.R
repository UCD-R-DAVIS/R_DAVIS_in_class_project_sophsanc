#1.Create a tibble named surveys from the portal_data_joined.csv file.
surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")
class(surveys)

#2. Subset surveys using Tidyverse methods to keep rows with weight between 30 and 60, and print out the first 6 rows.
surveys <- surveys %>% 
  filter(weight > 30 & weight < 60)
head(surveys)

#3. Create a new tibble showing the maximum weight for each species + sex combination and name it biggest_critters. 
  # Sort the tibble to take a look at the biggest and smallest species + sex combinations. 
  # HINT: it’s easier to calculate max if there are no NAs in the dataframe…
biggest_critters <- surveys %>% 
  filter(!is.na(weight), 
         !is.na(sex), 
         !is.na(species)) %>% 
  group_by(species, sex) %>% 
  summarise(max_weight = max(weight)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(-max_weight) ## arranged biggest --> smallest

biggest_critters %>% arrange (max_weight) ## view smallest --> biggest

#4. Try to figure out where the NA weights are concentrated in the data- is there a particular species, taxa, plot, or 
  # whatever, where there are lots of NA values? There isn’t necessarily a right or wrong answer here, but manipulate 
  # surveys a few different ways to explore this. Maybe use tally and arrange here.
surveys %>% 
  filter(is.na(weight)) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange()

surveys %>% 
  filter(is.na(weight)) %>% 
  group_by(taxa) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange()

surveys %>% 
  filter(is.na(plot_id)) %>% 
  group_by(taxa) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange()


#5. Take surveys, remove the rows where weight is NA and add a column that contains the average weight of each 
  # species+sex combination to the full surveys dataframe. Then get rid of all the columns except for species, sex, 
  # weight, and your new average weight column. Save this tibble as surveys_avg_weight.
surveys_avg_weight <- surveys %>% 
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% 
  group_by(species, sex) %>% 
  mutate(avg_weight = mean(weight)) %>% # use mutate to add new column (summarise would smoosh it into a summary)
  select(species, sex, weight, avg_weight)
  

#6. Take surveys_avg_weight and add a new column called above_average that contains logical values stating whether or 
  # not a row’s weight is above average for its species+sex combination (recall the new column we made for this tibble).
surveys_avg_weight <- surveys_avg_weight %>% 
  mutate(above_average = weight > avg_weight)
